            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm Penny, a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=terrier+profile&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi_iZv71YTUAhUIl1QKHW60DDcQ_AUICigB&biw=1247&bih=1220#imgrc=-eDU7ERKnaT14M">terrier</a> mix. Here's a <em>little</em> about me! I was born on the streets of downtown Los Angeles, probably near skid row. I don't remember, exactly, but it was definitely an unsafe environment for a puppy. Luckily, a wonderful lady found us and took us in to her shelter.</p>
            <p>We spent some time in her house, playing and sleeping, and eating some amazing puppy food. I felt really spoiled. My brother, Bronco, was the coolest out of all of us... He got a lot of attention from all the visitors to our rescue lady's storefront.</p>
            <p>One day, this pretty lady came into the store with her friend. She was going to go for Bronco, but then her friend was all, "this one's way cuter." I felt so flattered. She came back the next day with her boyfriend, and they played with me for a whole hour! They went home to think it over, and then they came back the following day to take me home with them!</p>
            <p>Ever since then, it's been smooth sailing. My human pets are the best ever... I just wish they took me to the park more often and led a more active lifestyle.</p>
